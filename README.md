# University-Recommendation-System
Back in India, students face difficulty in choosing the right university for their profile. There is always an ambiguity in choosing the best one which fits one's requirements. It can be made easy when narrowed down to a few options. In this project, we are building a recommender system which is based on a classification algorithm. This system recommends the students the best university for their higher education which is compatible with their GRE, English Proficiency Test scores, GPA (Academics) and also based on the previous records of the students who have secured an admission in that respective university.
